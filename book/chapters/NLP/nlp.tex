\chapter{Natural Language Processing}

In this chapter we introduce modern NLP libraries, techniques and their applications.
This chapter will focus on deep learning methods and less on computational linguistics that require nuanced knowledge of linguistics.
We explore what it means to represent words and sequences of words with rich numeric representations that are better-suited toward modern computational tasks.
We aim to capture some of these modern fine-tuned representations that are specially catered toward a semantic lexicon for medical language.
After finishing this chapter, one should have a general knowledge of the building blocks of state-of-the-art NLP models, and an understanding of how these
pieces fit together into a model such as GPT4\cite{openai2023gpt4}. Most importantly, we will present examples and patterns that help clinicians and researchers
use them in the field of epilepsy.
