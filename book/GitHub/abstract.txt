Programming in Python / R / Matlab Chapter
------------------------

    (working draft...)

    The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the readers to the programming tools necessary to carry out analysis and collaborative research in the field of epilepsy.
    To enable better collaboration, we begin by first reviewing version control and environment setup. We introduce readers to basic Github commands and python environment usage. 
    Once the environment is set up, we present a working example that covers some fundamental concepts as applied to EEG data (any time series data available). 
    Specifically, readers will be introduced to data structures, data extraction and loading. Various transformations, which include array indexing and data manipulations across different dimensions of the arrays will be presented. These will include various feature summarizations, data joining, and reshaping to handle spatio-temporal datasets. To achieve this, we will make use of well known packages such as pandas (plyr in R).

	Once the data is loaded and processed, readers will be guided through fundamental data analysis concepts and their implementation. We will discuss best practices for handling missing data, correlation analysis across space and time and data feature visualization.

	This step-by-step approach will provide all the tools necessary from initial experiment setup, through data manipulation, to visualizing and analyzing outcomes of time-series analyses in our domain.

	While we provide implementations in Python within the chapter, the corresponding code in R and MatLab is available in the appendix. The datasets and code, along with comprehensive instructions are provided in all three languages in the accompanying repository.
