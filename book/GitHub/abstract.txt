Programming in Python / R / Matlab Chapter
------------------------

    (working draft...)

    In this chapter, we aim to first emphasize a proper engineering boilerplate with which to standardize collaboriation. 
    To this end, we will first review version control and environment setup, and subsequently present a working example that covers some fundamental concepts as applied to epilepsy data. 
    Specifically, readers will be introduced to basic Github and python environment usage, data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL)...(finish this sentence). 
    This step-by-step approach will provide all the tools necessary between initial experiment setup, through data manipulation, to visualizing and analyzing outcomes of time-series analyses in our domain. 
    While we provide primarily examples in Python, with some examples in R and Matlab, comprehensive instructions with code are provided in all three languages in the accompanying repository.
